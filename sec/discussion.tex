    Incomplete due to missing results.\\

    Things to potentially include (depending on if I implement the feature or not):

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Limitation:} Requires additional artist input so not great, but mention that since standard light portals are already included in most pipelines it should be feasible to implement it.
        \item \textbf{Limitation:} Implementation presented is limited to AAplanes, give guidance on generalizing
    \end{itemize}
