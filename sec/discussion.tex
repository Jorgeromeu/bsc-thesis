    Incomplete due to missing results.\\

    Things to potentially include (depending on if I implement the feature or not):

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Limitation:} Requires additional artist input so not great, but mention that since standard light portals are already included in most pipelines it should be feasible to implement it.
        \item \textbf{Limitation:} Method presented is limited to certain combinations of portal shape and light shape, give general guidance on how to generalize
        \item \textbf{Future work:} Multiple portals, decide on which portal to sample based on frustum
        \item \textbf{Future work:} Multiple deciding which portal to sample based on frustum
        \item \textbf{Future work:} Chain portals against eachother and project $i$th portal to $i+1$th portal, good for very precise visibility constraint 
    \end{itemize}
