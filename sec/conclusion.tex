\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have extended the concept of light portals to be efficiently used with area lights. Our technique relies on geometric shadow volumes algorithms to determine the most effective sampling strategy depending on the location of the point being shaded. We demonstrated that this approach is more robust and efficient than alternatives for a variety of portal-light arrangements. Our method handles several lights and several portals and requires relatively low artist input.
