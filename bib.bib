  abstract = {We present a production-ready approach for efficient environment light sampling which takes visibility into account. During a brief learning phase we cache visibility information in the camera space. The cache is then used to adapt the environment sampling strategy during the final rendering. Unlike existing approaches that account for visibility, our algorithm uses a small amount of memory, provides a lightweight sampling procedure that benefits even unoccluded scenes and, importantly, requires no additional artist care, such as manual setting of portals or other scene-specific adjustments. The technique is unbiased, simple to implement and integrate into a render engine. Its modest memory requirements and simplicity enable efficient CPU and GPU implementations that significantly improve the render times, especially in complex production scenes.},

  abstract = {We present a technique to efficiently importance sample distant, all-frequency illumination in indoor scenes. Standard environment sampling is inefficient in such cases since the distant lighting is typically only visible through small openings (e.g. windows). This visibility is often addressed by manually placing a portal around each window to direct samples towards the openings; however, uniformly sampling the portal (its area or solid angle) disregards the possibly high frequency environment map. We propose a new portal importance sampling technique which takes into account both the environment map and its visibility through the portal, drawing samples proportional to the product of the two. To make this practical, we propose a novel, portal-rectified reparametrization of the environment map with the key property that the visible region induced by a rectangular portal projects to an axis-aligned rectangle. This allows us to sample according to the desired product distribution at an arbitrary shading location using a single (precomputed) summed-area table per portal. Our technique is unbiased, relevant to many renderers, and can also be applied to rectangular light sources with directional emission profiles, enabling efficient rendering of non-diffuse light sources with soft shadows.},

A new shadow-determination algorithm is presented that uses a data structure, called a backprojection, to represent the visible portion of a light source from any point in the scene. A complete discontinuity meshing algorithm is described for polyhedral scenes and area light sources, which includes an important class of light/geometry interactions that have not been implemented before. A fast incremental algorithm for computing backprojections is also described. The use of spatial subdivision, and heuristics based on computed statistics of typical scenes, results in efficient mesh and backprojection computation. Results of the implementation show that the use of the backprojection and discontinuity meshing permits accelerated high-quality rendering of shadows using both ray-casting and polygon-rendering with interpolants.},

The algorithm is simple and faster than Vatti’s algorithm [11], which was designed for the general case as well.

  abstract = {Recent advances in GPU technology have produced a shift in focus for real-time rendering applications, whereby improvements in image quality are sought in addition to raw polygon display performance. Rendering effects such as antialiasing, motion blur and shadow casting are becoming commonplace and will likely be considered indispensable in the near future. The last complete and famous survey on shadow algorithms — by Woo et al.52 in 1990 — has to be updated in particular in view of recent improvements in graphics hardware, which make new algorithms possible. This paper covers all current methods for real-time shadow rendering, without venturing into slower, high quality techniques based on ray casting or radiosity. Shadows are useful for a variety of reasons: first, they help understand relative object placement in a 3D scene by providing visual cues. Second, they dramatically improve image realism and allow the creation of complex lighting ambiances. Depending on the application, the emphasis is placed on a guaranteed framerate, or on the visual quality of the shadows including penumbra effects or “soft shadows”. Obviously no single method can render physically correct soft shadows in real time for any dynamic scene! However our survey aims at providing an exhaustive study allowing a programmer to choose the best compromise for his/her needs. In particular we discuss the advantages, limitations, rendering quality and cost of each algorithm. Recommendations are included based on simple characteristics of the application such as static/moving lights, single or multiple light sources, static/dynamic geometry, geometric complexity, directed or omnidirectional lights, etc. Finally we indicate which methods can efficiently exploit the most recent graphics hardware facilities.},

In this paper, we introduce a new concept that allows existing polygon meshes with arbitrary shaders in a scene to be used as generalized light portals. We also present an efficient sampling method that takes into account the pixel values of the environment map and ray guiding two-dimensional textures that are typically opacity or transparency maps. This novel sampling strategy can be combined with other sampling techniques by using multiple importance sampling. CCS Concepts: • Computing methodologies → Rendering; Ray tracing.},

  abstract = {A new family of clipping algorithms is described. These algorithms are able to clip polygons against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in three dimensions, removing the parts of the polygon which lie outside the volume. In two dimensions the algorithms permit clipping against irregular convex windows. Polygons to be clipped are represented as an ordered sequence of vertices without repetition of first and last, in marked contrast to representation as a collection of edges as was heretofore the common procedure. Output polygons have an identical format, with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe any newly-cut edge or edges. The algorithms easily handle the particularly difficult problem of detecting that a new vertex may be required at a corner of the clipping window. The algorithms described achieve considerable simplicity by clipping separately against each clipping plane or window boundary. Code capable of clipping the polygon against a single boundary is reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries. Each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only two vertex values and may begin its processing as soon as the first output vertex from the preceeding stage is ready. Because the same code is reentered for clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping against very complex window shapes is practical. For perspective applications in three dimensions, a six-plane truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping volume. The two additional planes parallel to the projection screen serve to limit the range of depth preserved through the projection. A perspective projection method which provides for arbitrary view angles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clipping planes is described. This method is ideal for subsequent hiddensurface computations.},
